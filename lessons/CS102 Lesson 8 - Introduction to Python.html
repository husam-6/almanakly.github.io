## Python 

TB - CH 1 - 5

---

## What is Python? 
- Python is an *interpreted* language, we mentioned this in lecture 1
- It's bread and butter is how simple yet powerful it is... You can write a really complicated program **really** easily, especially when you compare to C and Assembly 
- Python is probably the closest to human language a programming language can get 

---

## Python
- Python is really powerful and its very popular in industry 
- Ease of use and portability 
- You don't need a unix system!
- There are tradeoffs - its interpreted and therefore slower by default 
- It's actually built on top of C 

---

## Python - Dynamic Typing 
- Python is dynamically typed
- What does that mean... Recall in C whenever we declare a variable we had to specify what type it was ahead of time! Compiler could even tell you if you made a mistake since all types are known 
- In Python, you don't need to specify anything... We will get to this in a later slide 

---

## Python - Libraries 
- Something else we will talk about - the popularity of Python gives rise to TONS of documentation, written libraries, API's, SDK's etc etc. 
- Python is so widely used almost anything is easy to do now
- Libraries are literal code collections people wrote and uploaded for others to use as well, Python has a super easy to use manager called `pip`

---

## Installing Python 
- You will need to install Python
- https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Lookup a tutorial if you need. Most macs will already have a Python version installed 
- In this class we will use `python3` - make sure you aren't on Python2! 
- `python --version` or `python3 --version`

---

## Hello World 
- Just like we did in C, lets do the same thing Python 
- Print the chars "Hello World" to terminal

```
print("Hello World")
```

---

## Hello World
- Hopefully its clear how easy it is to use... No semicolons! 
- You can run a `.py` program with `python hello.py`
- `print` actually works ALOT like the print in C - you can give it multiple args, and theres actually something in Python called F strings which work super similar to `printf`
- Same concepts with special chars, backslashes etc 
---

## Python Shell 
- If you open up a terminal, and type in `python` it will open up a Python shell 
- You can execute python code here
- I regularly use a library built on top of this to do quick calculations, graphs, etc (`IPython`)

---

## Tracebacks 
- When you get an error in Python, you'll see whats called a `Traceback`

```
primt("Hello World")
```

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/husam/cs102/almanakly.github.io/test.py", line 1, in <module>
    primt("hello world")
NameError: name 'primt' is not defined. Did you mean: 'print'?
```

---

## Python Basics 

- The good news is everything we learned up until now is transferrable
- Loops, if statements, even structs have an equivalent (sort of)
- Lets start with the bare bones - comments are with `#` now instead of `//` in C

---

## Python Basics

```
# This is a program to show you basics in Python
# print function
 
print("Game Over")
input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
```

---

## Types, Variables 

- I mentioned earlier there are dynamic typing
- Ie I can have a variable store a string literal then overwrite it with a number later if I want
- String, `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, and a few others which we will get to `list` and `dictionaries` mainly 
- Strings are straightforward - you can have "regular string" or you could use """ three to have a multi line string 
```
"""
Super long 
multi long string 



captured between 
triple quotes
"""
```

---

## Arithmetic 
- Same as we know in C... basic arithmetic 

```
+------------+-------------------------+-------------+------------------------+
| Operator   | Description             | Example     | Evaluates To           |
+------------+-------------------------+-------------+------------------------+
| +          | Addition                | 7 + 3       | 10                     |
| -          | Subtraction             | 7 - 3       | 4                      |
| *          | Multiplication          | 7 * 3       | 21                     |
| /          | Division (True)         | 7 / 3       | 2.3333333333333335     |
| //         | Division (Integer)      | 7 // 3      | 2                      |
| %          | Modulus                 | 7 % 3       | 1                      |
+------------+-------------------------+-------------+------------------------+
```

---

## Variables 

```
class = "CS102"      # Note strings can actually be used with '' too!
x = 100
y = -13

class = x + y // 3
print(x, y, class)
```

- Super super simple and straight forward
- All the same principles still apply... Naming is still important 
---

## Variables 
- Strings can be concatenated super easily - `"CS102" + " Section C"`

```
print("\nThis string " + "may not " + "seem terr" + "ibly impressive. " \
+ "But what " + "you don't know" + " is that\n" + "it's one real" \
+ "l" + "y" + " long string, created from the concatenation " \
+ "of " + "twenty-two\n" + "different strings, broken across " \
+ "six lines." + " Now are you" + " impressed? " + "Okay,\n" \
+ "this " + "one " + "long" + " string is now over!")
```

---

## Variables

- You can cast variables in Python similar to C 

```
year = "2025"
year = int(car)
```

- Similar would apply for `float`, `str`

---

## Conditionals 
- Something we haven't explicitly mentioned yet - spacing matters in Python! Not like C at all in that regard
- This is important now when we talk about blocks and things like conditionals and loops 
- Again - the good news is all the same logical operators exist in actually a more readable way! 

---

## Conditionals 

```
# This is a Python library 
# (you might have to install if you were going to use it)
import random

# generate random numbers 1 - 6
die1 = random.randint(1, 6)
die2 = random.randrange(6) + 1
total = die1 + die2

print("Total: ", total)
if total == 7: 
	print("You rolled a 7!")
elif total > 7: 
	print("You rolled a high number!")
else:
	print("You rolled a low number!")
```

---

## Conditionals
- Note the syntax and the spacing 
- One indent after the block 
- if statement consists of `if expression:` colon is important!
- you can add parenthesis for readability or to enforce order of operations
- What would multiple ifs look like if they were nested 

---

## Conditionals
```
import random

# generate random numbers 1 - 6
die1 = random.randint(1, 6)
die2 = random.randrange(6) + 1
total = die1 + die2

print("Total: ", total)
if total == 7: 
	print("You rolled a 7!")
elif total > 7: 
	print("You rolled a high number!")
	if total * 5 > 20:
		print("4x our roll is greater than 20")
else:
	print("You rolled a low number!")
```

---

## While Loops 

```
i = 1
while i < 10: 
	print(f"this class rocks {i}x")
	i+=1
```

---

## While Loops

```
# Three Year-Old Simulator

print("\t Welcome to the 'Three-Year-Old Simulator'\n")
print("This program simulates a conversation with a three-year-old child.")
print("Try to stop the madness.\n")

response = ""
while response != "Because.":
    response = input("Why?\n")

print("Oh. Okay.")

input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
```

---

## For Loops
- For loops are super similar 
- Actually simpler in my opinion 
```
print("Counting!")

for i in range(10):
    print(i, end=" ") # end makes print not end in a \n

print("\n\nCounting by fives:")
for i in range(0, 50, 5):
    print(i, end=" ")

print("\n\nCounting backwards:")
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i, end=" ")
```

---

## For Loops
- `range` is a function and generates a list of numbers from the range provided
- 0 (default start) to end (non inclusive) in increments of 3rd arg (1 by default)

---

## Strings

- `in` function can check if something is literally in the second operator 
- Super intuitive when you see an example
- `len` operator gives you the length of a String

```
message = input("Enter a message: ")
print("\nThe length of your message is:", len(message))
print("\nThe most common letter in the English language, 'e',")

if "e" in message:
	print("'e' is in your message.")
else:
	print("'e' is not in your message.")
input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
```

---

## Strings

- You can still iterate through a string like we did in C with char arrays 

```
string = "Hello world"

for i in range(len(string)):
	print(string[i])
```

---

## Strings

- Another super useful element with indexing and lists (we will talk about these)
- You can use negative indexes! They wrap around like you may expect...

```
string = "Hello world"
print(string[-1])
```

```
   0   1   2   3   4
 +---+---+---+---+---+
 | i | n | d | e | x |
 +---+---+---+---+---+
  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
```

---

## Strings

- Another very useful construct - slicing 
- Note: alot of these will abstract to some of the other types we will learn, ie lists
- Slicing lets you get the elements in a specific set super easily and neatly 

---

## Strings

```
word = "pizza"
print(
"""
Slicing 'Cheat Sheet'
0   1   2   3   4   5
+---+---+---+---+---+
| p | i | z | z | a |
+---+---+---+---+---+
-5  -4  -3  -2  -1
"""
)

print("Enter the beginning and ending index for your slice of 'pizza'.")
print("Press the enter key at 'Start' to exit.")

start = None
while start != "":
	start = (input("\nStart: "))
	if start:
		start = int(start)
		finish = int(input("Finish: "))
		print("word[", start, ":", finish, "] is", end=" ")
		print(word[start:finish])
input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
```

---

## None
- None is like the `NULL` equivalent 
- It's a special type representing nothing 
- If you try to use anything with it, you'll get a Traceback 

---

## None

```
start = None 
start[0]
```

---

## Tuples 
- Tuples are a special type in Python 
- They are special groupings which can contain any type

```
# Hero's Inventory
# Demonstrates tuple creation
# create an empty tuple

inventory = ()
# treat the tuple as a condition
if not inventory:
	print("You are empty-handed.")

input("\nPress the enter key to continue.")
```

---

## Tuples 

```
# create a tuple with some items
inventory = ("sword",
			 "armor",
			 "shield",
			 "healing potion")

# print the tuple
print("\nThe tuple inventory is:")
print(inventory)

# print each element in the tuple
print("\nYour items:")

for item in inventory:
	print(item)

input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
```

---

## Tuples 
- Tuples are **immutable** - meaning once you make them you cant change it!
- You can index and you can use index slicing to access elements
- They will operate largely similar to lists which we will get to 
- `len` also works 

---

## Word Jumble Game 

```
# Word Jumble
#
# The computer picks a random word and then "jumbles" it
# The player has to guess the original word
import random

# create a sequence of words to choose from
WORDS = ("python", "jumble", "easy", "difficult", "answer", "xylophone")

# pick one word randomly from the sequence
word = random.choice(WORDS)

# create a variable to use later to see if the guess is correct
correct = word

# create a jumbled version of the word
jumble =""
while word:
	position = random.randrange(len(word))
	jumble += word[position]
	word = word[:position] + word[(position + 1):]
	
	
# start the game
print(
	"""
	Welcome to Word Jumble!
	Unscramble the letters to make a word.
	(Press the enter key at the prompt to quit.)
	"""
)
print("The jumble is:", jumble)

guess = input("\nYour guess: ")
while guess != correct and guess != "":
	print("Sorry, that's not it.")
	guess = input("Your guess: ")
	
if guess == correct:
	print("That's it! You guessed it!\n")
	
print("Thanks for playing.")
input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
```
