## Intro
- Name, Major, Year
  - What do you hope to get out of this class?
  - Icebreaker: Would you rather be itchy or sticky for the rest of your life? 
- How many of you have coded before? What languages?

---

## Course Website & Syllabus
- [Course main page](https://husam-6.github.io/almanakly.github.io/)
- [Syllabus](https://cooperunion-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/h_almanakly_cooper_edu/EZpAPMCf8wFKtmcXVgJOY2ABthHQD-jTOphIHVV9UiK-7A?e=S6aAYm)

---

## Computers and Software
- A computer is a machine that manipulates information by following instructions (software) and consists of physical components (hardware).

---

## Programming Languages
- This is how you interact with the computer and give it instructions 
- This can be high or low level 
- Computers only understand 0s and 1s at the lowest level (machine code)

---

## Programming Languages
- Assembly Language is a step up from this, abstraction but its still low level
 - Think of it as like a bunch of mnemonic macros for machine code instructions
 - C / C++ are high level languages (although C is still considered low since it proivdes direct memory access + management)
- Portable, powerful instructions, easier to maintain and write
- Python / Javascript are even 'higher' up the chain 
- These are *interpreted* languages
---

## Compiled vs Interpreted
- What is a compiler? 
	- A compiler reads in your code and translates it to machine code. This makes a compiled language very fast and efficient
	- C, C++ are compiled (there are others too of course, Go, Rust, etc) 

---

## Compiled vs Interpreted
- What is an interpreted language 
	- Code is executed line by line by an *interpreter*. This translates AND runs the code one at a time
	- Python, Javascript
		- Java is sort of half compiled half interpreted. Code is compiled into *bytecode* and executed by the JVM
---

## UNIX
- Unix is a family of operating systems which have become the base of Linux, Mac OS, Android, and others 
- You can develop in a Unix environment in a couple different ways 
	- Unix machine -> linux computer (all the computers in the labs are Linux)
	- MacOS -> OS Terminal. Pre-installed, click cmd + space and search for Terminal to find it 
	- WSL / Ubuntu -> Windows. This is a Unix environment you can install on windows which will let you dev in the same environment
---

### Common Commands
- There are tons of commands that you should get familiar with over time. I don't know them all nor could I teach them all. But we can go over a bunch of common examples. Google is your best friend with these, there are tons of resources for every one! 

- `man <cmd>`
	- if you ever forget the way to use a command, this will open up the *man page* for it.
	- "man ls"
- `ls <file or directory>`
	- list the files in the provided destiation 
	- Many args you can pass to do different things 
	- ls -la -> long list all files including ones with period at the start

---

## Common Commands

- `cd <directory>`
	- This and ls are your bread and butter. Use it to navigate your file system via the command line! 
- `mkdir <name>`
	- create a directory 
- `pwd`
	- path to your current directory 
- `touch <file name>`
	- create an empty file 
- `mv <file1> <file2>`
	- Move a file to a new destination, or rename a file

---
## Common Commands

- `cp <file1> <file2>`
	- Copy a file
- `rm <file>`
	- remove a file 
- `grep `
	- grep -rnH "pattern" directory
- `diff file1 file2`
	- diff two files
- `chmod permissions file`
	- Change mode `chmod 777 file` will usually suffice for anything you need if youre lazy

---

## Git & GitHub
- Git is a framework which powers all of the software world. It's open source and has many major benfits
- Version Control 
- When you write software, you are always writing in iterations. Things break, you fix them, different things break, you fix them.
- Oftentimes YOU will break things and introduce bugs! 
- Git let's you save a snapshot of the changes you make. You can navigate back and forth between changes and change state to a version that was working when things are not working properly!

---

## Git & GitHub
- Collaboration: Software teams are usually large and will have multiple people working in the same repository or package 
 - Git gives you a framework for *branching* and working in different states without impacting each others work 
- Durability: It's not an uncommon problem to lose things you have locally. Think of photos, files, music, etc on your phone, computer, ipads, etc etc 
 - Git is the way you backup things so that they are *durable* and you don't lose them

---

## What is Github?
- GitHub is the microsoft platform that uses Git 
- It's free to use and you can use this to store your code, manage it, and collaborate with your classmates 
- I would *HIGHLY* recommend you learn how to use Git and use it for the rest of your college career. Store major projects, even assignments and notes!
- Set up and connect GitHub on your machine, there are many docs: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git

---

## Commands 
- Git is a framework - there is a CLI you should learn 
- git status 
	- This tells you the state of your changes. What files did you modify? What files did you add which were not tracked previously? 
- git add *file*
	- Add a file to be tracked. When you make changes this stages it to be saved 
- git commit -m "Message"
	- This commits your staged changes. A commit is a unit of changes that you can mush together

---

## Editors & Shell Scripts
- An editor is where you can write code 
- You can write code just about anywhere (though not everywhere is recommended)
	- vim
	- emacs
	- notepad++
	- VSCode, IntelliJ, PyCharm, Eclipse and many other IDE's
- vim or emacs are the basics, and you should be able to use one in the case when you can't install one of the others

---


## vim Quick Guide
- `vim filename` -- to start editing a file with vim
- `ESC :w` -- write/save the file
- `ESC i` -- insert before the character
- `ESC a` -- insert after the character
- `ESC :q` -- quit vim
- `ESC :q!` -- quit vim and override unsaved changes
- `ESC :wq` -- save and quit vim

---

## Bash / Shell Scripts
- Think of this as a script which will execute Unix commands you specify. 
- Very useful for certain tasks

```
#!/bin/bash

mkdir new_folder
cd new_folder
touch new_file.txt
ls
```

---

## Bash / Shell Scripts
- First line is called a 'shebang' and it specifies the interpreter you want to use

```
chmod 777 unix_commands.sh
./unix_commands.sh
```

---

## Programming in C
- We mentioned you need a specific environment to dev
	- You need to be able to run `gcc`. 
- Set up Ubuntu for Windows WSL [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
- Set up gcc for Windows WSL [here](https://learnubuntu.com/install-gcc/).
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install gcc
```    
- Mac - Run `gcc` and install XCode

---

## Parts of a Program 
- When you write a program there are core parts which you should get familiar. We will explore much of these in detail over time 
- Variables & functions
	- Functions are a sequence of statements to execute together
- When you are finished, you need to compile the code which results in an executable file

---

## Hello World!
- The starter program for every programmer, for every language
- Print a statement to the terminal!

```
vim hello.c
```
File content: 

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	printf("Hello world!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

Run with 
```
gcc hello.c
./a.out
```

---

## Create a Repo, Save your work
- This is how we will submit homework and I will grade your assignments 
- On github.com create a repo, initialize with a README. 
- Clone it on your local 
```
git clone <copied ssh link>
```

---

## Branching
- I mentioned a valuable tool is collaboration. Branching lets you create a separate workspace in the same repo to save and develop. 
- Then later you can merge into main!
```
git checkout -b helloBranch
```
- This creates a new branch, you can save your work and push it here, without touching the main branch 
```
git add hello.c
git commit -m "first commit"
git push origin helloBranch
```

---

## Branching
- Create a PR by navigating to GitHub page now for your repo
- Have it reviewed and merge into mainline!

---

## Textbook 
Textbooks are not required for the course, but they may be useful to have. These two are the two I reference.
- [The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition - Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M. Ritchie](https://amzn.to/2LovuOa)
- [Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition - Mihael Dawson](https://amzn.to/2LkVOIU)
I also reference notes from Professor Hong who has great github.io: https://hong3cooper.github.io/

## Homework
- See Teams assignment
- Will have instructions for how we want to review and submit assignments in this class

  }

  // Initial call with longer delay to ensure slides are loaded
