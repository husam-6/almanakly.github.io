## Review

Last [lesson](./lessons/CS102%20Lesson%201%20-%20Intro,%20Unix,%20Git.html) we went over the class, Git, Unix, and other general intros. This lesson we begin to dive a bit into the C programming language. 

This class is by no means going to teach you everything about C. C is a complicated language and you could study it for years before even approaching that point. But we'll try to get you to a state where you can write and understand useful programs

---
## Functions

- Functions are a key part of programming in C. We discussed in last class how you can use it to define a set of instructions to execute
- *main* is a special function in C - this is where your program begins executions 
- Every program must have 1 main function somewhere

---

## Functions
- *Libraries* are collections of different programs written which you can utilize. 
  - In our hello world, we used Standard C Library with the directive `#include<stdio.h>`
	- This tells the compiler to include header file (basically definitions and declarations) for stdio (standard input / output library in C)
- You can communicate what to give to a function through *parameters* or *arguments*
- function(int arg1, char arg2) -> stuff inside the paranthesis are what you pass to the function 
- Statements must be between the curly braces 

---

```
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
	printf("Hello World!\n");
	return 0;
}
```
- printf is a function we are calling, and we passed it the argument "Hello World!\n" 
	- Note on ASCII representation of letters
- This is a character string or string constant
- Escaped sequences -> special characters, hard-to-type
- \n is a newline character - this function will not put output on a newline by default!
- \b is backspace
- \t is tab 
- \\\" is for double quotes

---

## Variables
- Functions are super useful to do a specific task. What do you use inside a function though? How do you accomplish a more complicated task?
- You can have *local* and *global* variables. We will discuss the difference of these in a future lesson, for now just think about variables in the general sense
- Think of a variable as a place you can dump data, which can often change unless specified
	- In a *statically typed* language you need to define what kind of data you put (C, C++, Java)
	- In a *dynamically typed* language, you don't have to (Python, Javascript)

---

## Variable Name Restrictions
- Names are made up of letters and digits
	- Underscore counts as a letter!
	- Don't begin variable names with underscore, however, since library routines often use such names
- Case sensitive
- Use lower case for variable names & all caps for constants
- Cannot use reserved keywords

---

## Variable Name Best Practices
- This will sound nerdy, but the naming matters alot!
- You should pick something which is related to what purposes the variable serves
- It's a common principle in CS that you should be able to read some code without any comments (if its written in a descriptive fashion)

```
char a;
int aa;
short aaa; // these are bad!

char firstInitial;
int totalMilesTravelled;
short currentFlightMiles;
```

---

## Constants
- Constants should be all caps - these are variables which are not going to change
	- its bad practice to have 'magic numbers' (random constants without any context)
- You can also use `#define` to define a constant (this is called a macro)

```
#include <stdio.h>
#define PI 3.14

void main()
{
    int radius = 2;
    float area = PI * radius * radius;
    printf("%f", area);
    return;
}
```

---

## Types 
- In C there are a few major types you should be familiar with 
	- int - integers. This depends on your machine but often 32 bits (4 bytes)
	- A bit is a 0 or a 1. You will learn how to read Binary in other classes, for now we won't get into the details. 
	- `-2^31 to 2^31^` range if signed, `0 to 2^32^ -1` if unsigned

---

## Types
- float - floating point decimal, how you can represent decimals, often 32bit
- char - character, 1 byte (or 8 bits). 
- short - short integer (2 bytes)
- long - long integer (8 bytes)
- double - double precision floating point (8 bytes)
- There are also arrays, structs, unions, and enums which we will get to later 
- And POINTERS!

---

## In code:
```
char a; // a single byte
int i; // an integer; max is based on machine
float f; // single-precision floating point number
double d; // double-precision floating point number
short int si; // decreases the size of an int; int can be omitted
long int li; // increase the size of an int; int can be omitted
```

---

## Limits
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int main()
{
    printf("CHAR_MIN: %d\n", CHAR_MIN);
    printf("CHAR_MAX: %d\n", CHAR_MAX);
    printf("SHRT_MIN: %d\n", SHRT_MIN);
    printf("SHRT_MAX: %d\n", SHRT_MAX);
    printf("INT_MIN: %d\n", INT_MIN);
    printf("INT_MAX: %d\n", INT_MAX);
    printf("UINT_MAX: %d\n", UINT_MAX);
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Wrapping
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char c = 'C';
    printf("%c", c + 255);
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Arithmetic 
- As we see in that example, we can do simple math in C very expressively! 
- In something like Assembly, this isn't possible and you need to execute the right instructions in the right order... You may do a project like this in Computer Architecture!
```
	celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;
```

---

## Arithmetic
- Integers are not decimals... That division by 9 will *truncate* the output, this is called *integer division*
	- Truncation means we just drop everything after the decimal, it is **not** rounding
	- 21 / 2 = 10
- Arithmetic in C follow PEMDAS as you may expect
	- Parenthsis
	- Exponents
	- Multiplciation / Division
	- Addition / Subtraction

---

## Arithmetic Operations 
- In addition to traditional operations, we have the modolu (%) operator
- This gives you the remainder of a division operation 
- 10 % 2 = 0
- 11 % 2 = 1
- 12 % 15 = 12

---

## Arithmetic Operation
```
x % 2 == 0
```

- This check is very *very* common - checks if a number if even!

---

## Relational Operators and Boolean Logic
- In C, 1 is treated as True and 0 is treated as False. There are no booleans out of the box
- There are a few common operators you are likely familiar with 
	- Greater than (>)
	- Less than (<)
	- Greater or equal to (>=)
	- Less than or equal to (<=)

---

## Relational Operators and Boolean Logic
- Equal to (==) and Not equal to (!=) have lower precedence
- Unary operator (!) negates an expression
- Relational operators are lower down the chain from arithmetic operators
	- 1+4 <= 4 evaluates to false 

---

## Logical Operators
- These are your bread and butter, and they make the world run!
	- Logical AND (&&) 
	- Logical OR (||)
- Evaluated left to right
- Short circuit if truth or falsehood is determined
- Note: these are not the same as (&) and (|) which are bitwise operators (we will learn this later)

---

## Conversions 
- What happens if you add two different types together? 
- There are a set of rules defining precedence for what happens exactly 
- In general, the automatic conversions only apply to those that convert a `narrower` operand into a `wider` one without losing information
	- eg integer into a float 
	- Can lose precision if we go the other way

---

## Conversions
- Note: char is just a smaller integer! Can be used freely in expressions...
- Different machines may have different standards for conversions
	- ie when converting a char to an int, sign vs zero extension
- Assignments can also cause conversions (right converted to left)

---

## Casting 
- `(type-name) expression`
- if you need to force the type you need, not typically recommended

---

## Converting Temps

```
#include <stdio.h>
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */

int main() {
	// Declare variables
	int fahr, celsius;
	int lower, upper, step;

	// ASSIGN
	lower = 0; /* lower limit of temperature scale */
	upper = 300; /* upper limit */
	step = 20; /* step size */
	fahr = lower;

	// ITERATION - WE WILL DISCUSS THIS
	while (fahr <= upper) {
		celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;
		printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius); // Note the functionality of printf!
		fahr = fahr + step;
	}
}
```

---

## Converting Temps
- Taken from the textbook, this function will calculate Fahrenheit - Celsius conversions
- Comments (either // or /\* \*/ for multi line) are how you can document your code. Super important! These get skipped by the compiler 

---

## Continuation of our Function 
- Let's breakdown further what we did 
- We *declared* a few variables and then *assigned* a value to each 
- Eg `int upper; upper = 0;` - This can be combined in a single line too! `int upper = 0`
- We used a `while` loop here to iterate while a certain condition is true. We will revisit this later 
```
while (fahr <= upper) {
	...
}
```

---

## A note on Readability
- In the above code, notice how we indented certain lines
- In C this is not necessary, but is HIGHLY encouraged to keep code maintainable
- Technically speaking, the entire line could be written on the same line as long as you have the proper syntax! 
- Indenting things correctly makes it easier to follow and build on
- There are even different schools of thought for braces, including on the same line or on next line

---

## Excercise 
- Run our program with a few of these
- Try \c
- Show some examples with argument substitution

---

## Excercise 
- Can we play with the temperature function to make it print better? 
	- modifiers to arg replacements (eg "%6d")
- Can we fix arithmetic issues? (grab a row and compare to the *real* calculation)
	- 0F is not exactly -17C...
