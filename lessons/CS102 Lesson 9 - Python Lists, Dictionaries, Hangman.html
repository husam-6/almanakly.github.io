## Python Lists, Dictionaries, Hangman
TB CH 5 - 

---

## Lists and Dictionaries 
- Probably the most useful types in Python - *lists* and *dictionaries*
- Tuples are great but they are immutable. You can't change them after creation
- Lists do everything tuples do + more! You can dynamically add / remove items of any type! 
- Dictionaries are named pretty well - given some key you can lookup its counterpart
- Recall the hash table we implemented in C

---

## Lists
- Lists are sequences like tuples, but they are *mutable*
- They are denoted with `[]`
- A pattern you will see often is initializing an empty list and then *adding to it* or *removing from it*

---

## Lists

```
# create a list with some items and display with a for loop
inventory = ["sword", "armor", "shield", "healing potion"]
print("Your items:")
for item in inventory:
	print(item)
input("\nPress the enter key to continue.")
```

---

## Lists
- Everything you can do with tuples applies to lists 
- What if you wanted the size of the list? Use the `len` function!

```
# get the length of a list
inventory = ["sword", "armor", "shield", "healing potion"]
print("You have", len(inventory), "items in your possession.")
input("\nPress the enter key to continue.")
```

---

## Lists

- Indexing is identical to what we've seen - use the bracket notation!

```
index = int(input("\nEnter the index number for an item in inventory: "))
print("At index", index, "is", inventory[index])
```

---

## Lists

- The *in* operator is super useful to check if an element is literally in the list 

```
# test for membership with in
inventory = ["sword", "armor", "shield", "healing potion"]
if "healing potion" in inventory:
	print("You will live to fight another day.")
```

---

## Lists

- Slicing works the same way as tuples 
- Super super useful to get parts of the list you are interested in 
- Powerful libraries like numpy use the same (more or less super similar) patterns

---
## Lists 

```
# display a slice
start = int(input("\nEnter the index number to begin a slice: "))
finish = int(input("Enter the index number to end the slice: "))
print("inventory[", start, ":", finish, "] is", end=" ")
print(inventory[start:finish])
input("\nPress the enter key to continue.")
```

---

## Lists

- Manipulating lists and its element is pretty intuitive
- You can 'add' two lists (which just concatenates things)

```
chest = ["gold", "gems"]
print("You find a chest which contains:")
print(chest)
print("You add the contents of the chest to your inventory.")
inventory += chest
print("Your inventory is now:")
print(inventory)
input("\nPress the enter key to continue.")
```

---

## Lists 

- You can overwrite an existing list element 

```
# assign by index
print("You trade your sword for a crossbow.")
inventory[0] = "crossbow"
print("Your inventory is now:")
print(inventory)
input("\nPress the enter key to continue.")
```

---

## Lists 

- Deleting and adding list elements is also super portable 
- Be wary of this though, its inefficient because when you remove something in the middle, you need to shift everything over

```
# delete an element
print("In a great battle, your shield is destroyed.")
del inventory[2]
print("Your inventory is now:")
print(inventory)
input("\nPress the enter key to continue.")
```

---

## Lists 

- Appending a value is one of the most common patterns I use with lists 
- If you couldn't tell already, lists are like arrays (from C) older but slower brother

```
counts = []
for i in range(0, 100):
	counts.append(f"NUMBER{i}")
```

---

## Lists

- An interesting feature is that you can nest lists 
- This is a multi dimensional array in a way, but not exactly 

```
grid = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]]
grid[1][0]
```

---
## Dictionaries 
- Now we move on to the other most powerful type in Python 
- Lists were useful when you had a *sequence* of items you need to organize
- What if you had data which really comes in pairs? And you need quick lookups? 
- Dictionaries work with *key value* pairs 

---

## Dictionaries 

```
# Geek Translator
# Demonstrates using dictionaries
geek = {
	"404": "clueless. From the web error message 404, meaning page not found.",
	"Googling": "searching the Internet for background information on a person.",
	"Keyboard Plaque" : "the collection of debris found in computer keyboards.",
	"Link Rot" : "the process by which web page links become obsolete.",
	"Percussive Maintenance" : "the act of striking an electronic device to make it work.",
	"Uninstalled" : "being fired. Especially popular during the dot-bomb era."
}
```

---

## Dictionaries 

- Another super useful use case is storing counts. We talked about this in C when we introduced structs 
- Say we wanted to count all the occurrences of a letter in a sentence 

```
# Fancy example
sentence = "CS102 is my favorite class and I would take it maybe 6 or 7 times"
counts = {}
for letter in sentence: 
	if letter in counts:
		counts[letter] = counts[letter] + 1
	else: 
		counts[letter] = 1
```

---
## Dictionaries 

- You can access dictionary elements using `get` method or with `[]` notation
- You need to give the key to fetch the value 
- `get` has the benefit of allowing you to default a value 
- You can also efficiently check if our key is already in the set

---

## Dictionaries 

```
# Fancy example
sentence = "CS102 is my favorite class and I would take it maybe 6 or 7 times"
counts = {}
for letter in sentence: 
	counts[letter] = counts.get(letter, 0) + 1
```

## A Note on References

- We haven't gotten to functions yet, but introducing lists and dictionaries warrants the discussion 
- For mutable variables like lists, dictionaries, strings - Python stores a reference to that variable.

```
# SHALLOW COPY!
mike = ["khakis", "dress shirt", "jacket"]
mr_dawson = mike
honey = mike
```

## Hangman

- We are going to write a program for hangman using lists and dictionaries

```
HANGMAN = (
    """
    ------
    |     |
    |
    |
    |
    |
    |
    |
    ----------
    """,
    """
    ------
    |     |
    |     O
    |
    |
    |
    |
    |
    ----------
    """,
    # ... and so on ...
)
```

---

## Hangman

```
MAX_WRONG = len(HANGMAN) + 1
WORDS = ("BRUH", "CHAT", "TYPE", "IS BRO FR", "PYTHON")

# initialize variables
word = random.choice(WORDS)
so_far = "-" * len(word) # one dash for each letter in word to be guessed
wrong = 0 
used = []

print("Welcome to Hangman. Good luck!")
```

---

## Hangman

```
while wrong < MAX_WRONG and so_far != word:
	print(HANGMAN[wrong])
	print("\nYou've used the following letters:\n", used)
	print("\nSo far, the word is:\n", so_far)
	
	guess = input("\n\nEnter your guess: ")
	guess = guess.upper()
	while guess in used:
		print("You've already guessed the letter", guess)
		guess = input("Enter your guess: ")
		guess = guess.upper()
	used.append(guess)
	
	if guess in word:
		print(f"Yes! '{guess}' is in the word!")

		new_word = ""
		for i, letter in enumerate(word): 
			if word[i] == guess: 
				new_word += guess
			else:
				new_word += so_far[i]
		so_far = new_word
	else:
		print("\nSorry,", guess, "isn't in the word.")
		wrong += 1

print(f"The word was {word}")
