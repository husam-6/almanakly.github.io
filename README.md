# Husam Almanakly – Fall 2025 CS102 @ Cooper Union Course Information

---
### Course Description
This course introduces core concepts in computer science through hands-on programming in C, with a brief introduction to Python. Students will develop a solid foundation in problem solving, algorithmic thinking, and building software. Topics include variables and data types, control flow (selection statements and loops), functions, structures, and pointers. Multiple programming projects provide practical experience in writing, testing, and debugging code. This is not an extensive course in C or Python programming; rather, it focuses on teaching the basics and core fundamentals.
